# WebWinFormsInteraction - An approach to use parts of your legacy app in a modern web app 

This demo was made for an article in the Windows Developer magazine which was printed in November 2018.

The article descripts an approach to migrate a huge legacy pc app to a modern web app step-by-step. To release asap the usage of old functionality in the new app is a good option. Usually it's not possible to migrate code from decades within a year.

In the Demo the web client an the locally installed WinForms app communicate through a SignalR Hub which is also installed on the users computer.
